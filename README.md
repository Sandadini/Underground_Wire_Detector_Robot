# Underground_Wire_Detector_Robot
Automated robotic car designed to detect &amp; map underground wires. It uses a GY271 HMC5883L magnetometer to sense magnetic fields, transmitting data via Bluetooth HC05 to a Python script on a PC for real-time plotting. Powered by an ATmega328p microcontroller, the system provides a portable solution for underground wire detection.
